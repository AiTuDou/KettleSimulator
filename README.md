## Kettle Simulator (Godot)

### Introduction
A very simple kettle simulator written using the Godot game engine.

Creates a websocket server exposed on port `50102`, for an agent to connect to.

Agent code here: [Kettle Agent](https://github.com/AiTuDou/KettleAgent.git).

_Note:_ This code is an attempt to demonstrate the concept of a simple simulator and be simple to understand, it's not supposed to be production quality code.
